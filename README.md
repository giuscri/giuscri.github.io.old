I'm using this space offered by github to host
my italian translation of the amazing article by
*Peter Norvig* titled [*Teach yourself programming
in ten years*](http://norvig.com/21-days.html).

You can see the current result at [http://giuscri.github.io](http://giuscri.github.io)

## TODO:

+ Change last table-style to a more modern HTML+CSS.
+ Change repo's tree (e.g. `index.html` might look
as the 'index' page of the Apache webserver) and move
this article to a inner node.
